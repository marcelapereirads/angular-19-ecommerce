This project does not include a backend, as its purpose is solely for study and experimentation with Angular's frontend capabilities.

## Features

- **Signals**: Reactive state management using Angular's new signals API.
- **Component-based architecture**: Modular and reusable components.
- **Dependency Injection**: Service for managing shared state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Dynamic UI**: Components updated based on the application's state.
